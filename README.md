Configuring
===========

For the most part, configuring is a matter of adding various developer keys from online services. These 
configuration options are contained in a few limited source files.

!!! WARNING !!!
There are two copies of these files listed in the project. The ones in the folder "credentials" are not used by the 
application. They are only referenced there to make developers lives easier, and help avoid pushing private credential
information to github.

1. ImgurAPICredentials.h - You application ID registered with https://api.imgur.com/
2. CreeperSHKConfigurator.m - ShareKit integration keys instructions at: http://getsharekit.com/install/ 

!!! Notes on ShareKit integration !!!

(as of March 5th 2013)

In step 3, the instructions call for info in SHKConfig.h this has been duplicated in CreeperSHKConfigurator.m.
