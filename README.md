At this point the project should compile. Tested on xcode 4.6 with iOS 6.1. 

Configuring
===========

For the most part, configuring is a matter of adding various developer keys from online services. These 
configuration options are contained in a few limited source files.

!!! WARNING !!!
There are two copies of these files listed in the project. The ones in the folder "credentials" are not used by the 
application. They are only referenced there to make developers lives easier, and help avoid pushing private credential
information to github.

1. ExternalServices.h - You application ID registered with https://api.imgur.com/ (And optional crashlytics api key)
2. CreeperSHKConfigurator.m - ShareKit integration keys instructions at: http://getsharekit.com/install/ 



Notes on ShareKit integration

If you want to explore the app the ImgurID is mandatory. The ShareKit credentials, however, you can leave as the defaults. 
This will simple limit the app from "share image" and "share link".

(as of March 5th 2013)
Creeper is pre-configured for ShareKit. You only need to do step 3 in the install instructions.
In step 3, the instructions call for info in SHKConfig.h this has been duplicated in CreeperSHKConfigurator.m. 
Reading this will give you enough information to get the basics configured.
