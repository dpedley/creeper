About / Questions
How does the video capture screen work?
This will get it's own help in a future version, but here are the basics.

You can add a frame to the animation by pressing and holding the video. (The video stream acts like one big button.) This will continue to add frames until your data buffer is full. (Current 50 low quality frames, or 16 normal quality) Your other option, to add frames, is to tap the frame count button. ( The button with the 0/50 for a new animation. ) This will record just one frame, stop animation style.

The trash button will clear the current frame buffer.

The "Small" and "Normal" controller will toggle between video resolutions.

Rotating the device will switch between portrait and landscape video capture.

If you make a video change when you have existing captured frames, the app will ask you to confirm clearing the buffer for a new capture. (For example if you begin a video and then rotate the camera, it will ask you if you want to clear the buffer and restart.)

My uploads are failing.
It could just be network issues, but....

A known problem is the upload limit of 2mb imgur sets for animated gifs. Creeper tries to stay within that limit by having a maximun frame count. This doesn't always work. Try fewer than the maximum frames, perhaps 45 in low res, or 12 in normal mode. Future version will solve this problem so you never lose a video.

Who made this?
My name is Doug Pedley, I'm a software developer. This is a personal project I took on. You can find me at dpedley.com

Why did you make this?
Why is it free?
Creeper started as a platform to learn the AVFoundation, and as I got more comfortable, I added enough features that I thought others might find it useful. It's free because it's built atop many other great free projects, I just lashed it all together.

Where is the source?
How do I build it?
Creeper is housed at github.com/dpedley/creeper instructions can be found in the Readme

What about the images?
Why the name creeper?
Are you creepy?
The splash screen is an old, now public domain, illustration by Henrik Gr√∂nvoldof. The birds are Eurasian Treecreepers. The name creeper came to me first as a synonym for vine, then after I found the illustration, I was decided. I don't think I'm creepy, and I certainly don't condone anyone using creeper for creepy purposes. O_o

Thanks for trying out creeper!
